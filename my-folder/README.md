# TripleTen Spring 3 Project - Shopper Habits and Retention Rates
This project analyzes shopper habits and retention patterns using real user activity data. The goal was to understand where users drop off in the conversion funnel, how long they remain engaged after their first purchase, and what behaviors drive retention.

### ✨ Important Analysis Terms
`Conversion Funnel Analysis`: Tracks users from product views → add to cart → checkout → purchase.
`Retention Analysis`: Cohort-based tracking to measure how user activity changes month over month.
`Purchase Activity Insights`: Identifies patterns in first purchases, repeat customers, and churn.
`Data Visualization`: Interactive dashboards built with Tableau to present funnels, cohorts, and retention curves.

### 🎯 Roots of Retention
Businesses often struggle to understand why customers leave after their first interaction. This project was built to help identify bottlenecks in the funnel, understand long-term engagement, and provide actionable recommendations to improve conversion and customer loyalty.

### 📊 Results
Out of 10,453 users, only a fraction completed the funnel, revealing significant drop-offs between viewing and checkout.
Retention rates declined sharply after the first purchase, with engagement stabilizing among loyal repeat customers.
Cohort analysis showed stronger retention in earlier cohorts, suggesting changes in marketing or product experience impacted later groups.

### Key takeaway: reducing friction in the checkout stage and improving post-purchase engagement could significantly improve retention.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQL – for querying and structuring user activity data
Tableau – for interactive dashboards and data visualization
Excel – for data preparation and documentation

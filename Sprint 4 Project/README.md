# Superstore Returns Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes product returns from a retail superstore dataset using Tableau.
The goal was to identify the scale of the return problem, uncover root causes, and provide a dashboard tool for ongoing monitoring.

🔎 Key Insight: Our return rate is 27.05%, more than double the industry average of 3–10%.

🎯 Features & Functionality

Dashboard with Two Lenses

Macro View: Category-level analysis of return rates and costs.

Micro View: Sub-category and customer-level deep dives.

Multiple Metrics

Return Rate (%) → Identifies product issues.

Total Return Cost ($) → Measures profit loss.

Return Count → Supports operational planning.

📊 Key Findings

Technology dominates returns: Phones & Machines have the highest return rates.

Seasonal spikes: August, September, and December align with back-to-school & holiday sales.

Regional pattern: The West region consistently shows the highest return rates.

Customer behavior: A small number of repeat customers are driving high return counts.

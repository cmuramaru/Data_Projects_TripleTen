# Superstore Returns Analysis
### 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes product returns from a retail superstore dataset using Tableau.
The goal was to identify the scale of the return problem, uncover root causes, and provide a dashboard tool for ongoing monitoring.

### 🎯 Features & Functionality

`Macro View`: Category-level analysis of return rates and costs.<br>
`Micro View`: Sub-category and customer-level deep dives.<br>
`Filters & Drilldowns`:<br>
  - Product category: Helps stakeholders focus on the category they own or manage
  - Region and state: Drill into state-level return rates with a heatmap
  - Customer behavior: Identifies repeat returners who may be costing the company disproportionately

`Return Rate (%)` → Identifies product issues.<br>
`Total Return Cost ($)` → Measures profit loss.<br>
`Return Count` → Supports operational planning.<br>

### 📊 Key Findings

Technology dominates returns: Phones & Machines have the highest return rates.
Seasonal spikes: August, September, and December align with back-to-school & holiday sales.
Regional pattern: The West region consistently shows the highest return rates.
Customer behavior: A small number of repeat customers are driving high return counts.

### 🖼️ Visuals

Here are some of the dashboard highlights (add your own screenshots or GIFs):

Above: Return Rate by Category → Technology leads with 27% return rate.<br>
Below: Return Rate by Month → Clear seasonal spikes in Aug, Sept, Dec.<br>
Bottom Left: Heatmap by State → Returns concentrated in West, Texas, and Northeast.<br>
Bottom Right: Category by Region Matrix → The West is the return hotspot.<br>

Above: Sub-Category Scatterplot → Phones, Machines, and Chairs = high sales + high returns.<br>
Bottom Right: Return Rate by Customer → A few customers returned 100+ items.<br>
